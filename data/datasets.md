The goal of this page is to provide a survey of existing datasets targeting sexism in social media, 
along with a summary of the data collection and labeling mechanism and potential issues. This should give 
a good overview of which datasets can and should be used in research, as well as learnings about how to
improve our own collection and labeling process. 

If you want to add a dataset to this page, please make sure to include the info bellow: 

- paper/blogpost that accompany the published dataset as title
