We are currently relying on 3 datasets for our research and modeling efforts: 

1. Waseem, Zeerak, and Dirk Hovy. "Hateful symbols or hateful people? predictive features for hate speech detection on 
twitter." Proceedings of the NAACL student research workshop. 2016. (check 
[Hate speech](#Hate-speech) section)

2. Anzovino, Maria, Elisabetta Fersini, and Paolo Rosso. "Automatic identification and classification of misogynistic 
language on twitter." International Conference on Applications of Natural Language to Information Systems. 
Springer, Cham, 2018. (check [Automatic Misogyny Identification](#Automatic-Misogyny-Identification ) section)

3. A dataset that we collected and labeled. Check [Our Annotations](#Our-Annotations) section for a full description
of our process.


These 3 datasets are combined into what we call the **gold dataset**. 

The next 3 sections provide an overview of how the data was collected and labeled in the form of data statements
